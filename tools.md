## Tool 9:
- **Name of the tool**: SPARQL micro-services
- **Description**:
    The SPARQL Micro-Service architecture is meant to unlock data silos hidden behind proprietary Web APIs by equipping them with a lightweight SPARQL endpoint. The whole idea is about bringing Web APIs into the Web of Data and making it possible to integrate Linked Data and Web APIs within a simple federated SPARQL query. 
    
    A SPARQL micro-service encapsulates a Web API and typically yields a **small, resource-centric graph** generated dynamically. It can be seen as a **configurable** SPARQL endpoint in that it expects parameters, e.g. a SPARQL micro-service to find photos from Snapshat may expect tags.
    
    An interesting use of SPARQL micro-services is to **assign dereferenceable URIs to Web API resources** that do not have URIs in the first place. For instance, https://sparql-micro-services.org/ld/flickr/photo/31173091626 is the dereferenceable URI of a photo in Flickr. The content is generated dynamically based on the photo identifier.

- **Mapping language**: (which mapping language(s) is supported by the tool) : SPARQL construct
- **Supported data (formats, sizes)**: mainly JSON-based Web APIs, XML-based Web APIs can be adapted too
- **Programming language**: php

    - Provide provenance information as part of the graph generated
    - Simple configuration with a config.ini file, or with rich SPARQL Sescription Description and SHACL shapes graph
    - Dynamic generation of HTML documentation + test interface from the SPARQL micro-service Sescription Description see [example](https://sparql-micro-services.org/service/flickr/getPhotosByTags_sd/))
    - Autmatic markup of HTML documentation as schema.org Dataset to allow webscale discoverability of SPARQL micro-services, e.g. with Google Dataset Search

## Tool 10:
- **Name of the tool**: WordLift Plugin
- **Description**: 

WordLift is a WordPress plugin that brings state-of-the-art semantic technologies to the hands of any blogger and publisher: without requiring any technical skills, it helps produce richer content and organize it by suggesting facts and information to provide readers with meaningful context and adding semantic markup to the text to help machines fully understand any website.

Features:

  * Text Analysis: WordLift analyzes content and identifies matching entities organized in 4 categories: Who, What, When and Where.
  * Tag Content: Editors can accept the suggested entities to add contextual info for the user, efficiently selecting internal links to existing content.
  * Create New Entities: Editors can create new entities providing additional context and enriching the web site Knowledge Graph. WordLift will learn and next time they will be detected.
  * Edit Entities: Editors can edit all entities to customize the Knowledge Graph around the web sites' audiences and build new relationships.
  * Images: WordLift suggests open license images and media from own library, saving the time usually spent searching for visuals.
  * Geomaps: Locations in articles can quickly be mapped adding the Geomap widget.
  * Timelines: Events can be displayed chronologically adding the Timeline widget.
  * Chords: Visualize what relates to what in every article adding the Chord widget.
  * Navigator: Recommend relevant articles adding the Navigator widget.
  * Faceted Search: Suggest additional content related to the topics found in your article, letting readers dive into your archive with the Faceted Search widget.
  * Meaningful Navigation: WordLift automatically identifies topics in articles, using Wikipedia’s classification system. This allows to create new entry points for content based on topics, events, people and places.
  * Publish Search Data: WordLift automatically adds schema.org markup articles, allowing search engines to properly index and display content and intelligent agents such as Siri and Alexa to access it.
  * Publish Linked Data: WordLift publishes content’s metadata.

- **Special features**: Use SPARQL to query popular distributed data sources, e.g. files in Hadoop, NoSQL stores _on-the-fly_ i.e. without requiring pre-processing or ingestion. Disparate data may be joinable by declaratively altering some of its atrributes thanks to the use of the FnO ontology. State-of-the-art Big Data query engines are used for the querying, namely Apache Spark and Presto. Squerall can programmatically be [extended](https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/Squerall#extensibility) to use another query engines e.g. Drill or Dremio)
